          We regularly invite club members to attend our virtual meetups, with
          the plan to hold physical meetups in 2022. Activities include company
          introductions, tech talks, lightning talks and social. This is a great
          way to meet design tech hybrid people across companies.
          <div className="news-title">Conversations</div>
          Every club member loves to chat in our design tech club slack
          workspace. This is a great corner for members to gather information
          such as new technologies, job postings, and networking opportunities!
